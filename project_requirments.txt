A great small project idea to help you learn and integrate **Spring Boot**, **Microservices**, **RabbitMQ**, and **Keycloak** would be creating a **Simple Task Management System**. Here's how you can break it down:

### Project Idea: **Task Management System with User Authentication and Notifications**

#### Project Overview:
Build a task management application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The system will use **microservices architecture** to separate concerns, such as task management, user management, and notification services. You'll also integrate **RabbitMQ** for event-driven communication between microservices and **Keycloak** for securing the system with user authentication and authorization.

### Key Features:
1. **User Management Microservice**:
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - Secured using **Keycloak** for OAuth2-based authentication and authorization.
   
2. **Task Management Microservice**:
   - Users can create, update, delete, and view tasks.
   - Each task will have attributes like title, description, due date, and status (e.g., "Pending," "Completed").
   - **CRUD operations** on tasks.

3. **Notification Microservice**:
   - Sends notifications when certain events happen, such as task creation, completion, or update.
   - Uses **RabbitMQ** to send event-based messages between the Task Management service and Notification service.

4. **Integration with RabbitMQ**:
   - Task Management service publishes messages (e.g., task created/updated) to a **RabbitMQ queue**.
   - The Notification service listens to the queue and sends notifications to users.

5. **Keycloak Integration**:
   - Set up **Keycloak** for user authentication.
   - Protect the APIs by assigning roles such as "USER" and "ADMIN."
   - Users can only manage their own tasks, and admins have access to manage all tasks.

### Architecture Breakdown:
1. **User Service** (Spring Boot Microservice):
   - Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Secured by Keycloak.

2. **Task Service** (Spring Boot Microservice):
   - Handles task creation, update, deletion, and viewing.
   - Publishes task events (like task created, task completed) to **RabbitMQ**.

3. **Notification Service** (Spring Boot Microservice):
   - Listens to RabbitMQ queues and sends email or in-app notifications to users when tasks are created or updated.

4. **API Gateway** (Optional):
   - Use an API gateway to route requests to different microservices and secure the endpoints using Keycloak.

### Tech Stack:
- **Spring Boot** for developing microservices.
- **RabbitMQ** for event-driven communication between services.
- **Keycloak** for user authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for data storage.
- **Docker** for containerizing the microservices.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Microservices communication with RabbitMQ.
- Securing microservices with Keycloak.
- Building event-driven applications.
- Managing users and tasks in a scalable and decoupled way.
